# LabNotes

This project aim is to implement collaborative text editor such as Google Docs and pair it with groups and supervising features.

The Idea came from a friend of mine who is working in chemistry laboratory. Most useful notes like this online are paid
and offer wide range of features that might not be useful for project keeping and supervising within a student's group.

The main function is to create documents and tables that track chemical reactions done withing a scope of a paper or
a project. Such list has to be available to the supervisor. He also needs to be able to provide comments and make edits.
Documents should provide access control and be visible only to those who are privileged to view them.
